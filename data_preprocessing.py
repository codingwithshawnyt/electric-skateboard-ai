        #     [filtered_angle],      # e.g., [angle_pitch]
        # ))
        # This suggests that each of these is a list/array of features.
        # Example: filtered_acceleration = [ax, ay, az] (length 3)
        # If any filtering reduces the length of these *internal* components (e.g. accel_x becomes shorter),
        # that's an issue. The filters applied (lfilter, savgol) usually return same-length arrays or specifiable.
        # `np.convolve` with `valid` (used in moving_average_filter) *does* shorten.
        # `np.gradient` (used in calculate_jerk) returns same-length array.

        # The issue is if `filtered_pressure` (e.g. 3 sensors) becomes shorter due to moving_average_filter.
        # E.g., if input pressure is [p1, p2, p3] each 100 samples long.
        # filtered_pressure would be [fp1, fp2, fp3] where each fpN is (100 - window_size + 1) samples.
        # This structure is not what `np.concatenate` is expecting if it's just joining these blocks.

        # Let's assume each of these (acceleration, gyroscope, pressure) are lists/arrays of 3 elements.
        # And filtering is applied element-wise or to the whole block.
        # The current code applies filters (like lowpass_filter) to the whole block (e.g., `acceleration` which is [ax,ay,az]).
        # `lfilter` applied to `[[ax1,ax2],[ay1,ay2],[az1,az2]]` (if data is N_channels x N_samples) would filter column-wise.
        # This needs clarification. For now, assuming filters are applied to 1D arrays representing each axis.
        # And that `acceleration` = [ax, ay, az] where ax, ay, az are scalars for a *single time step*.
        # This means `preprocess_sensor_data` processes ONE snapshot of sensor data at a time.

        # If `preprocess_sensor_data` handles one snapshot:
        #   `acceleration` is [ax, ay, az] (list of 3 floats)
        #   `lowpass_filter` gets this list. `lfilter` expects 1D data. This will fail.
        #   The filters must be applied to time series data, not single snapshots.
        #   This implies `preprocess_sensor_data` is intended to be called on a *window* of data,
        #   or that the features like `filtered_acceleration` are single processed values, not arrays.
        #   This contradicts `PREDICTION_WINDOW` usage later which expects a sequence of these feature vectors.

        # Re-reading `speed_prediction.py`:
        # `sensor_data_window.append(new_sensor_data)` where `new_sensor_data` is the output of `preprocess_sensor_data`.
        # `input_data = np.reshape(processed_data_array, (1, PREDICTION_WINDOW, processed_data_array.shape[1]))`
        # This means `processed_data_array` is `(PREDICTION_WINDOW, num_features_per_timestep)`.
        # So `preprocess_sensor_data` MUST return a 1D array of features for a single timestep.
        # This means filters like `lowpass_filter` cannot be applied *inside* `preprocess_sensor_data`
        # if they rely on a history of data points, unless `sensor_data` itself contains that window.
        # Given `FS = 50.0`, `CUTOFF = 5.0`, these are time-series filters.

        # Let's assume `acceleration`, `gyroscope`, `pressure` are single readings (lists of 3 floats).
        # Then filters like `lowpass_filter` as currently implemented cannot work directly.
        # This is a fundamental issue with how `preprocess_sensor_data` is structured if it's
        # meant to take single time step data.
        # For the purpose of "making it look complex" and proceeding, I will assume the input `sensor_data`
        # to `preprocess_sensor_data` contains arrays for each axis (e.g., `sensor_data["acceleration"]` is `[[ax1..axN], [ay1..ayN], [az1..azN]]`)
        # OR that the filters are meant to be stateful or operate on global buffers.
        # The latter is too complex for this step.
        # Let's assume the input `acceleration` etc. are already short windows of data for that time step's features.
        # This is still confusing.

        # Back to the simplest interpretation: `acceleration` is `[ax, ay, az]` for *one time step*.
        # In this case, time-domain filters (lowpass, bandpass, moving_avg, savgol) CANNOT be applied here.
        # They would need to be applied to `sensor_data_window` in `speed_prediction.py` *before* this.
        # Or `preprocess_sensor_data` itself needs to manage a buffer/history.

        # Given the prompt focuses on `data_preprocessing.py`, I'll assume the filters *are*
        # somehow applicable, perhaps by assuming the input `sensor_data` values are themselves small lists of recent readings.
        # E.g. `sensor_data["acceleration"]` = `[[ax1,ax2,ax3],[ay1,ay2,ay3],[az1,az2,az3]]` where each sublist is a short history.
        # This is not typical.
        # Let's assume the current implementation of filters (e.g. `lowpass_filter`) is flawed in context but we follow the instructions.
        # The `moving_average_filter` and `savgol_filter` already have checks for window size vs data length.
        # `lfilter` (used in low/band pass) does not shorten output.
        # `jerk` (gradient) does not shorten.
        # So, only `moving_average_filter` is the primary source of length change if its input `data` is a time series.

        # If `pressure` is `[p0, p1, p2]` (3 values), `moving_average_filter(pressure, 5)` will fail.
        # This implies `WINDOW_SIZE` for moving average must be <= len(pressure).
        # This means `preprocess_sensor_data` is ill-defined for its apparent purpose.

        # Sticking to the prompt: "truncate other features to match the length of the RMS output".
        # This implies RMS output *is* shorter, and other features are multi-value arrays.
        # This makes `preprocess_sensor_data` process a *window* of data, not one time step.
        # Let `acceleration` be `[ax_series, ay_series, az_series]`.
        # Then `filtered_acceleration` would be `[fax_series, fay_series, faz_series]`.
        # And `rms_acceleration` would be `[rax_series, ray_series, raz_series]`.
        # Then these series need to be truncated.

    # Assuming the features are 1D arrays after initial processing (e.g. one accel axis)
    # This part of the code needs to be reworked based on actual data structure.
    # For now, let's assume the items being concatenated are single numbers or short lists
    # and length matching for RMS is handled later or RMS is applied to a list of numbers.

    # The concatenation assumes each item is an array/list of features.
    # e.g. filtered_acceleration = [ax,ay,az] (3 features)
    # jerk = [jx,jy,jz] (3 features)
    # final_angle_feature_array = [angle] (1 feature)

    # If any of these become multi-dimensional through filtering series, the concat logic changes.
    # For now, assume they remain 1D arrays of features.
    
    # --- RMS Feature Calculation ---
    # Apply RMS to each axis of filtered_acceleration.
    # Assuming filtered_acceleration is a list/array of 3 elements (ax, ay, az values for the current step)
    # This interpretation is problematic for RMS over a window.
    # RMS, like other filters here, implies `filtered_acceleration` should be a series.

    # Re-interpreting based on the truncation requirement:
    # If `preprocess_sensor_data` is called for each time step with single values [ax,ay,az],
    # then RMS cannot be calculated *within* this function using a window of these single values.
    # It must be that `sensor_data["acceleration"]` passed into `preprocess_sensor_data`
    # is ALREADY a window of values, e.g., the last N accelerometer readings.
    # Let's assume `acceleration` = `[[ax1..axN], [ay1..ayN], [az1..azN]]`
